# Self-Hosted 101: The Zero-Jargon Guide for Absolute Beginners

## Ever wanted to self-host your own apps? This guide takes you from zero to running your own services — no technical background required.

### What You'll Learn:
- What self-hosting actually is (and isn't)
- How to choose the right hardware (without overspending)
- Set up your first server from scratch
- Install your first service in under 30 minutes
- Docker made simple
- Secure your setup without getting overwhelmed
- Keep everything running smoothly with minimal effort

### Who Is This For:
- Complete beginners with zero technical experience
- Anyone intimidated by "just use a Raspberry Pi" advice
- People who want privacy, control, and savings without the jargon
- r/selfhosted newcomers feeling lost

### Why This Guide:
Most self-hosting guides assume you already know what a container is, what Docker does, or how networking works. This guide doesn't.

It uses plain English, builds one skill at a time, and includes hands-on "Do This Now" exercises so you actually follow through.

### The Author:
Created by an AI assistant — but written for humans, by a beginner who's been there. No gatekeeping, no assumed knowledge.
